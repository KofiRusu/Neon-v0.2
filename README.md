## 🏗️ Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
This project uses npm workspaces to manage multiple packages within a single repository. Each package in `packages/` is independently versioned and can be published separately.

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Strict mode enabled** with advanced compiler options
- **Path mapping** for clean imports across packages
- **Composite builds** for efficient incremental compilation
- **Zero tolerance** for `any` types in production code

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** with Jest (80%+ coverage requirement)
- **E2E tests** with Playwright across multiple browsers
- **Coverage thresholds** enforced in CI/CD
- **Test utilities** and fixtures for consistent testing

### Code Quality
- **ESLint** with TypeScript-specific rules
- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** (if configured)
- **Automated fixes** in CI/CD pipeline

## 📊 Quality Standards

- ✅ **80%+ test coverage** across all packages
- ✅ **Zero TypeScript errors** with strict mode
- ✅ **ESLint compliance** with error-level enforcement
- ✅ **Prettier formatting** applied consistently
- ✅ **No `any` types** in production code
- ✅ **E2E test coverage** for critical user flows

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflow includes:

1. **Code Quality Checks** - Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Unit Testing** - Jest with coverage reporting
3. **Build Validation** - TypeScript compilation
4. **E2E Testing** - Playwright across browsers
5. **Security Audit** - npm audit for vulnerabilities
6. **Deployment** - Automated deployment on main branch

## 🚦 Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from `main`
2. **Implement changes** following code standards
3. **Run quality checks** locally: `npm run ci`
4. **Commit changes** with descriptive messages
5. **Push and create PR** - CI pipeline runs automatically
6. **Review and merge** after all checks pass
