### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface OutreachConfig {

  dailyEmailLimit: number;
  followUpIntervals: number[]; // Days between follow-ups
  autoReplyAnalysis: boolean;
  templates: EmailTemplate[];
}
```

## Email Templates

Templates support variable substitution using `{{variableName}}` syntax:

```typescript
const template = {
  id: 'followup_1',
  name: 'First Follow-up',
  subject: 'Re: {{originalSubject}}',
  content: `Hi {{firstName}},
  
  I wanted to follow up on my previous email about {{topic}}.
  
  Best regards,
  {{senderName}}`,
  variables: ['firstName', 'originalSubject', 'topic', 'senderName'],
  type: 'followup1'
};
```

## Lead Scoring

The scoring system evaluates leads across five key factors:

1. **Profile Completeness** (0-100): How much information is available
2. **Job Relevance** (0-100): How relevant their role is to your offering
3. **Company Size** (0-100): Company size scoring based on target preferences
4. **Recent Activity** (0-100): How active they are on social platforms
5. **Contactability** (0-100): How easy they are to reach

## Reply Analysis

The reply analyzer classifies responses into five categories:

- **Positive**: Interested, wants to schedule a call
- **Negative**: Explicitly negative, wants to be removed
- **Neutral**: Acknowledges but doesn't commit
- **Not Interested**: Politely declines
- **Request Info**: Asks for more information

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Lead Scoring

You can customize the lead scoring by extending the OutreachAgent:

```typescript
class CustomOutreachAgent extends OutreachAgent {
  scoreLead(leadData: EnrichedLead): LeadScore {
    // Custom scoring logic
    const customScore = this.calculateCustomScore(leadData);
    return {
      total: customScore,
      factors: {
        // Custom factors
      },
      reasoning: 'Custom scoring applied'
    };
  }
}
```

### Integration with CRM

```typescript
// Example integration with a CRM system
const leads = await agent.scrapePotentialLeads(criteria);

for (const lead of leads.data.leads) {
  const enriched = await agent.enrichLead(lead);
  const score = agent.scoreLead(enriched.data);
  
  // Save to CRM
  await crm.createLead({
    ...lead,
    score: score.total,
    enrichmentData: enriched.data.enrichmentData
  });
}
```
